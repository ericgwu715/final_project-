Our Project Team are interested in understanding real estate market in Seattle Metropolitan area, where there is a great concentration some of the world biggest tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft. We found the data on houses from Kaggle. Using Machine Learning, we analyzed and developed models that can predict house prices based on some selected features for houses in th area.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/shivachandel/kc-house-data

Data set details: The dataset consists of house data from King County in US State of Washington, this data also covers Seattle. The dataset consisted of 21 variables and 21613 observations, including historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015.

We developed the models using Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms. 
We aim to predict the sales of houses with an accuracy of at least 75-80% and understand which factors are responsible for higher property value.
